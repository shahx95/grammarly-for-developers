# Grammarly Text Editor SDK Activation Example

This demo shows the different options for the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) [activation property](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/v2.x/api/editor-sdk/editorconfig#activation).

## Try the demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-activation?file=/public/index.html).

## How it works

This example contains two files that are identical except for the value of the `activation` property:
- [index.html](./public/index.html) sets `activation` to `immediate`
- [activationFocus.html](./public/activationFocus.html) sets 'activation' to `focus`

Both pages contain a textarea and listen for [document-stats](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/editor-sdk/grammarlyeditorpluginelementeventmap#document-stats) and [session-stats](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/editor-sdk/grammarlyeditorpluginelementeventmap#session-stats) events. When the events are fired, the pages update the "Word count" and "Suggestions accepted" lines on the page.

Note that when `activation` is set to `immediate`, the plugin automatically checks the words in the textarea, displays an underline to show a word is misspelled, and fires the events that ultimately lead to the page being updated. When activation is set to `focus`, those actions do not occur until the user focuses on the textarea.
