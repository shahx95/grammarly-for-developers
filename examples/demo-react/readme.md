# Demo React App

This demo React app displays a `<textarea>` with sample text in it. You can use this app while exploring how to use the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/).

## Try the Demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/demo-react?file=/src/Editors.js).

Note that this demo does _not_ contain the code for using the SDK, so Grammarly suggestions will not appear in the app automatically.

## How it Works

The app contains a `<textarea>`. You can add Grammarly suggestions to the `<textarea>` by creating a [new Grammarly for Developers app](https://developer.grammarly.com/apps) and then following the Quick Start instructions for a React app.

## Get the Code

A copy of this code is available in the [Grammarly for Developers GitHub repo](https://github.com/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/demo-react).
