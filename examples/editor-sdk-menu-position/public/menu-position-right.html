    <h1>Grammarly Button Menu Position</h1>
    <p>
      Select the Grammarly button beneath the text area. Notice that the menu
      opens to the <strong>right</strong> of the Grammarly button.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might notice that the Grammarly button is centered beneath the text 
      area, whereas in most examples in this repo, it appears on the right 
      (the default). We centered it so you can see the button menu opening to 
      the left and right of the button. Note that if there is not enough
      space for the menu to be displayed in the designated position, the menu will
      automatically be placed in a position where it will fit.
