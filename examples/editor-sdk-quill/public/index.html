      <h2>The basics</h2>

      <p>
        Mispellings and grammatical errors can effect your credibility. The
        same goes for misused commas, and other types of punctuation . Not
        only will Grammarly underline these issues in red, it will also showed
        you how to correctly write the sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Underlines that are blue indicate that Grammarly has spotted a
        sentence that is unnecessarily wordy. You'll find suggestions that can
        possibly help you revise a wordy sentence in an effortless manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        But wait...there's more?
      </p>

      <p>
        Grammarly can give you very helpful feedback on your writing. Passive
        voice can be fixed by Grammarly, and it can handle classical
        word-choice mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can even help when you wanna refine ur slang or formality level.
        That's especially useful when writing for a broad audience ranging
        from businessmen to friends and family, don't you think? It'll inspect
        your vocabulary carefully and suggest the best word to make sure you
        don't have to analyze your writing too much.
      </p>
