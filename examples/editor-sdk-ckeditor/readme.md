# Grammarly Text Editor SDK & CKEditor Example

This demo shows how to add the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/) rich text editor.

## Try the Demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-ckeditor?file=/public/index.html).

## How it Works

[index.html](./public/index.html) contains a `<div>`. The `<div>` is wrapped with the `<grammarly-editor-plugin>` tag, so that Grammarly suggestions will be displayed in the `div`. JavaScript code toward the bottom of the file creates a new [classic editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_editor-classic_classiceditor-ClassicEditor.html) instance in that `<div>` and also configures the Grammarly Text Editor SDK. See [index.html](./public/index.html) for the full code example.

Learn more about how to add Grammarly suggestions to rich text editors by visiting the [Grammarly for Developers documentation](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/#supported-text-editors).
