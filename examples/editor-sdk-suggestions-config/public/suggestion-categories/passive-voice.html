    <h2>Suggestion categories (Passive voice suggestions turned "on")</h2>
    <p>
      The Grammarly Text Editor Plugin on this page is set to show suggestions for the
      <code>"passiveVoice"</code> writing suggestion category.
      
      This category, which is muted by default, adds writing suggestions regarding the use of the passive voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try the Grammarly Text Editor Plugin in the text area below!</strong>
      <p>In this example, writing suggestions for avoiding the passive voice in favor of the active voice are turned "on".</p>
    </p>
    <grammarly-editor-plugin config.activation="immediate" config.suggestionCategories.passiveVoice="on">
      <div contenteditable="true">
        <p>

      </div>
    </grammarly-editor-plugin>
    <p>
      Configuring and muting suggestion categories is available only on the Grammarly Text Editor SDK Plus plan.
