    <h2>Suggestion Categories (Default)</h2>
    <p>
      Suggestion categories determine the type of stylistic suggestions that are visible ("on") or muted/not visible ("off") in the Grammarly Text Editor Plugin. 
      If your app is on the Plus plan, you can configure which suggestion categories are on or off in the plugin. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that if a user has connected their Grammarly account to your application, the full set of customized suggestions from their user profile will always take precedence (overriding these configurations).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try the Grammarly Text Editor Plugin in the text area below!</strong>
      <p>In this example, writing suggestions for unnecessary ellipsis are turned "on".</p>
    </p>
    <grammarly-editor-plugin config.activation="immediate" config.suggestionCategories.unnecessaryEllipses="on">
      <div contenteditable="true">
        <p>
          Please bring me a pencil, eraser and notebook...
        </p>
      </div>
    </grammarly-editor-plugin>
    <p>
      Explore these other pages to try configurations that turn on different categories of writing suggestions:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/suggestion-categories/oxford-comma.html">The Oxford comma</a> (<code>"oxfordComma"</code>)</li>
        <li><a href="/suggestion-categories/passive-voice.html">Passive voice</a> (<code>"passiveVoice"</code>)</li>
        <li><a href="/suggestion-categories/stylistic-fragments.html">Stylistic fragments</a> (<code>"stylisticFragments"</code>)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Default settings for Suggestion Categories</h2>
    <p>
      By default, the Grammarly Text Editor SDK mutes (turns "off") seven categories of writing suggestions.
