# Grammarly Text Editor SDK & CKEditor Example (Imperative)

This demo shows how to add the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/) rich text editor. The example uses [addPlugin()](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/editor-sdk/editorsdk#addplugin) to add the Grammarly suggestions in an imperative way.

## Try the demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-ckeditor-imperative?file=/public/index.html).

## How it works

[index.html](./public/index.html) contains a `<div>`. JavaScript code toward the bottom of the file creates a new [classic editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_editor-classic_classiceditor-ClassicEditor.html) instance in that `<div>` and also adds Grammarly suggestions to that `<div>`. See [index.html](./public/index.html) for the full code example.
